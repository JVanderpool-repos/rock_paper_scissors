To complete the GUI setup, please download the following images and place them in this directory:

1. rock.png - An image representing a rock
2. paper.png - An image representing paper
3. scissors.png - An image representing scissors

The images should ideally be:
- Square format (1:1 aspect ratio)
- At least 200x200 pixels
- PNG format with transparent background
- Clear, easily recognizable symbols

You can find suitable free images from sources like:
- flaticon.com
- icons8.com
- game-icons.net

Note: The GUI will still work without images, displaying text buttons as a fallback.
